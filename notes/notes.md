# For LOOP
    same set of instruction again and again unless the condition become false
    But For loop depends on the collection

    syntax:
        for i in collection:
                            collection can be Range, str, list,tuple,set, dict
    
    In for loop we dont hae to intialze, update the collection it autoaticlly get updated
# range()
    range is a inbuilt function which is used to set the flow of collection by lower, upperlimit
    syntax:
            range(startingpoint,endingpoint,step)

    whenever we deals with number we use range function.

# continue()
    ✔ continue is a keyword which is used to skip the iteration without breaking the loop.
    ✔ In this process we dont put any conditions on continue.
    ✔ It will work for for loop, while loop both.

for i in range()


# pass
    it is a keyword which make empty block as a valid block

# Intermediate terminating loop:
    These are the loops where it come out of thee loop unfortunstely at a given instance
    using some key words this phenomenon is known as temination loop

    this process is unpredictable it can work any time.

    1. Break
    2. Continue
    3. Pass

    Break is a keyword which eliminate the loop at a single point where controler come out 
    of the loop and it cant go back
        syntax:
                break
        example:
            for i in range(1,11):
                if i ==5:
                    break
                print(i)
# Nested for loop:
    These are the for loop where same set of instructions are done again and again until and unless the condition become false but ths loop contains
    a loop inside a loop in the form of for loop where the inner loop is dependent on the outerloop.

    syntax: 
        for var in collection:
            for var in collection:

# Cpitalize()
